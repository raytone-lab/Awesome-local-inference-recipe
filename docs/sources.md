# Data sources / 数据来源

Where recipes come from and how they are checked. Every recipe links to its original source; we store only a link, a short summary and the numbers.

| Source | Role | What it gives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | Primary | Measured tok/s, hardware, community heat | Many reposts — we trace back to the original post |
| Hugging Face model cards | Primary | Benchmark tables from quant authors (prefill / decode t/s) | Hardware often missing; reviewed by hand |
| r/LocalLLaMA | Primary (manual) | Consumer-hardware reports | Manual review only |
| GitHub (engine repos, llama.cpp discussions) | Primary | Official bench threads, release notes | |
| llamabench.ai / LocalScore / llamaperf | Cross-check | Benchmarks with commands | Linked, not copied |
| Hacker News | Discovery | New engines and projects | |
| arXiv | Discovery (methods) | Speculative decoding, quantization, KV cache | Datacenter numbers are not added as recipes |

## Source levels
- 🏛️ **Official** (官方) — published by the model/engine/hardware vendor.
- ✅ **Measured** (实测) — the poster ran it themselves and shows a screenshot or log of the run.
- 🔁 **Relayed** (转述) — second-hand report of someone else's result.
- 📣 **Claimed** (宣称) — marketing, a prediction, or an unverified claim with no screenshot/log or no way to reproduce it (e.g. an unpublished private build).

## Hugging Face ingestion (maintainers)
`python3 scripts/ingest_hf.py --limit 40` (optional `HF_TOKEN`) scans trending GGUF/MLX cards and writes candidates to `data/candidates/` (git-ignored). It never writes `data/recipes.json`. Candidates are reviewed with `python3 scripts/review_candidates.py list | show <id> | approve <id> | reject <id>`; only approved items enter the dataset. Batch approval: `python3 scripts/approve_review.py <review.json>`.

## Rules
No estimates, no invented values — unknown fields are `null`. No full-text copies of posts.
